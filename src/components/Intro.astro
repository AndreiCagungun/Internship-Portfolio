                            By the third week, interns were immersed in
                            technical work. They were introduced to Dify, a
                            no-code platform for building conversational AI apps
                            through comprehensive training sessions with our

                            Divided into four teams, they were tasked with building
                            BookStop, a smart library assistant. With just 10 days
                            to develop their project, each team demonstrated remarkable
                            creativity and collaboration.

                            Five interns took up the challenge of rebuilding the

                            From weeks 7 to 10, interns transitioned into
                            real-world application mode. Each team was assigned
                            to work on MyStaff Projects, focusing on features
                            like authentication, authorization, and secure data
                            handling.<br />
                            They created two versions of their apps:
                            <ul>

                            These projects pushed interns to balance technical accuracy
